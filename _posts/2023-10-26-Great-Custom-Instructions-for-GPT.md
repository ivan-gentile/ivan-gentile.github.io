# Introduction

In an era where conversational AI bridges gaps in global communication, language can still be a barrier. ChatGPT, based on OpenAI's GPT-3.5, has been instrumental in breaking down these walls. And now, we've taken it a step further by adding Italian language support. This post explores how we modified the ChatGPT developer edition to make this exciting feature a reality.

## New Feature: Italian Language Support

We've recently rolled out a significant update to the ChatGPT developer edition. The chatbot can now respond in Italian, making it even more versatile and accessible to a broader audience. To activate this feature, use the `/language Italian` command during your session.

### Markdown File Updates

1. **chatgpt__custom_instructions.md**: This file now includes a section that instructs the assistant to respond in Italian. Simply use `/language Italian` to set the assistant's output language to Italian for the session.
   
2. **chatgpt__about_me.md**: A new section has been added to highlight the assistant's capability to respond in Italian.

## Conclusion

The addition of Italian language support to ChatGPT opens up a myriad of possibilities, from enhancing customer service interactions to facilitating cross-cultural communication. This minor tweak in the developer edition exemplifies the potential for customizing conversational AI to meet diverse needs. Kudos to the original creators, and here's to a future without language barriers!
