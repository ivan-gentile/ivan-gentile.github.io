# Introduction

In a world where digital interactions form the crux of communication, language barriers can often feel like an iron curtain. One of the tools that have been aiding in seamless conversations is ChatGPT, a robust and capable chatbot rooted in OpenAI's GPT-3.5 architecture. However, as adept as it is, the default linguistic mode is English. This post recounts the adventure of modifying a particular GitHub repository to pave the way for dialogues in Italian, a tweak that can be mirrored for any language. 

The crux of this endeavor was [spdustin's ChatGPT-AutoExpert repository](https://github.com/spdustin/ChatGPT-AutoExpert). The goal was to take a dive into the code, rephrase certain segments, and set up custom instructions enabling the chatbot to respond in Italian. Though the modification was slight, it cracked open a door to a vast realm of possibilities, showcasing how a small tweak can significantly broaden the outreach of such a tool.

Additionally, during this exploration, another intriguing repository caught the eyeâ€”[daveshap's ChatGPT_Custom_Instructions](https://github.com/daveshap/ChatGPT_Custom_Instructions). Though it hasn't been put to rigorous testing, it hints at a promising avenue for further customization. It's amusing to think it may not be the go-to solution for anxious teachers, yet it holds a potential spark for many other applications.
